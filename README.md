## Usage Guide
It is for everyone (designers or developers) who wants to know how their website will look like on modern popular digital devices ie- smartphone, tablet as well as your personal computer. However it is recommended to test web applications on real devices to get more accurate results.

Write/copy any website url with or without http/https/www/ ie- scaledrop.net and hit enter thats it. Now after loading the full page you can check other resolutions navigating through the right panel, select any.

## Note
* You'll have to wait for the page to finish loading. It depends upon the website content how much time it takes. 

* As it's not the final version, there may be some bugs. If you find any and you want to help to make it improved please fork me on Github and if there any issue raise it there.
* You are free to use it anywhere you want.
